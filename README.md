# Basic Reason Template

A random quote front end over a DarkLang backend, just so I can screw around with DarkLang.

## Run Project

```sh
npm install
npm start # builds bucklescript in watch mode

# in another tab
npm run webpack # builds JS bundle

# in yet another tab
npm run server # runs hot-reloading dev server

# open http://localhost:8000/ in a web browser
# read quotes!
```

# Editor
If you use `vscode`, Press `Windows + Shift + B` it will build automatically
